# CrossDomainExploit
Code for exploiting insecurely configured Cross Domain XML file. Read through the readme for further instructions. 

1. Compile the actionscript crossDomain.as to swf with the following command after modifying the attacker dev desktop hostname. (You need to have Apache flex SDK installed)

`amxmlc crossDomain.as`

2. Copy crossDomain.swf to the same directory as crossDomain.html and server.py.
3. Place key.pem and cert.pem in ../ssl/
This is to make sure that the application would load over https. If certificate is signed by a trusted CA, there won't be any warning issued by the browser. If you want a non-ssl server, you need to modify server.py
4. Deploy the exploit on a devdesktop by running the command:

`sudo ./server.py 443`
